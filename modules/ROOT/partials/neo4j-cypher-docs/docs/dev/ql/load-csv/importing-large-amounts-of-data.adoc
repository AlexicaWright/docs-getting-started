== Importing large amounts of data ==
If the CSV file contains a significant number of rows (approaching hundreds of thousands or millions), `USING PERIODIC COMMIT` can be used to instruct Neo4j to perform a commit after a number of rows.
This reduces the memory overhead of the transaction state.
By default, the commit will happen every 1000 rows.
For more information, see <<query-using-periodic-commit-hint>>.

Note: The <<query-use, `USE` clause>> can not be used together with the `PERIODIC COMMIT` clause.
